# Project Scope: Tornado vs. Fire Tornado Comparison Script

## Requirements
1. **Python Classes**: Define two Python classes: `Tornado` and `FireTornado`.
2. **Attributes**: Each class should have the following attributes (as strings or appropriate types):
   - `formation_mechanism`
   - `primary_energy_source`
   - `typical_duration`
   - `destructive_potential`
3. **Representative Data**: Instantiate one object of each class with scientifically accurate, representative data based on meteorological knowledge.
4. **Comparison Function**: Include a function `compare_vortices(tornado, fire_tornado)` that prints a formatted, side-by-side comparison of these attributes.
5. **Output**: The output should be clear and easy to read for a non-expert, using a simple table or aligned columns.

## Example of expected attributes:
### Tornado
- Formation mechanism: Supercell thunderstorm mesocyclone
- Primary energy source: Latent heat release from condensation
- Typical duration: Minutes to hours
- Destructive potential: EF0‑EF5 (Enhanced Fujita Scale)

### Fire Tornado
- Formation mechanism: Intense ground‑level heat and wind shear
- Primary energy source: Combustion (heat from fire)
- Typical duration: Seconds to minutes
- Destructive potential: Extreme localized heat and ember transport

## Additional Notes:
- The script should be named `compare.py`.
- The code should be well‑documented with comments explaining key meteorological concepts.
- Use Python 3.6+ compatible syntax.

This document serves as the project plan and acceptance criteria for the feature.
